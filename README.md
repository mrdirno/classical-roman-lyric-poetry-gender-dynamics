### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where Aelia secretly teaches another young woman in the household to read lyric poetry, using the rhythms of weaving as a code.
- Create a subplot from Lucius's perspective: he discovers a political threat that mirrors Aelia's personal rebellion, forcing him to question his own rigid worldview.
- Imagine a clandestine literary salon Aelia discovers, run by freedwomen in the Subura. Detail a meeting where a new, dangerous poem is shared.
- Write the 'lost' poem Aelia writes about her marriage, using the metaphor of the Tyrian purple dye—its beauty, its cost, and its stain.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a text analysis tool that compares the linguistic patterns in Aelia's internal monologues (provided in seed chapters) with actual Catullan verse, highlighting thematic and metric echoes.
- Design an interactive map of a Roman domus (house) keyed to chapters, where clicking on rooms (tablinum, lararium, etc.) reveals excerpts of text where that space is charged with gender/power dynamics.

## Origin

Generated through persona500's Council-Prism Generation.
SASI evaluation: 8/10

Council: Sappho of Lesbos (for lyric intimacy and female voice), Tacitus (for political tension and the psychology of repression), Charlotte Brontë (for the interior life of a constrained woman), James Joyce (for stream of consciousness and the subversion of epic tradition)
